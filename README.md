# 32-bit-MIPS-Processor-with-5-Stage-Pipeline
A 32-bit microprocessor designed with a 5-stage pipelined architecture to execute MIPS ISA programs, including arithmetic, data movement, and flow control operations, with data hazard and forwarding mechanisms.

This microprocessor supports the following operations
Arithmetic/Logic: AND, OR , NOR, ADD, SUB, SLT, ADDI, MULTI, DIV
Data movement: LW , SW, MFHI, and MFLO
Flow control: Beq, j
Data and Structural Hazards are also prevented through the use of Data Hazard and Data Forwarding units.
